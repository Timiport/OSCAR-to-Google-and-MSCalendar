# OSCAR-to-Google-and-MSCalendar
A application to automatically fetch course information from Georgia Tech's OSCAR and convert it in to events in Google calendar and Microsoft Calendar

## Get Started

Run 'Calendar-Converter.exe' to launch the program

### Google Calendar
Click 'Google Calendar' which will bring you to the login page. 

Beware that you will get a warning screen when you login with Google. (rant) I have really tried verifying this software with Google, but after 20 back and forth emailing, it is just a completely headache dealing with them. Since this project is mainly used by me, I don't want to bother with this. But if someone really wanted it, just put is in issues and I could resume the process. 

### Microsoft Calendar
Click 'Microsoft Calendar' in the login window.
After following with the login prompt in the browser, you will see a blank page with a random generated url
![alt text](gui/icon/MSLogin.PNG)

Simply copy and paste this url in the new window prompted from the program and click 'verify', which will log you in.

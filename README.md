# OSCAR-to-Google-and-MSCalendar
A application to automatically fetch course information from OSCAR and convert it in to events in Google calendar and Microsoft Calendar

## Get Started

Temporarily (before I fix the bug in executable), running Calender-Conver.py in runner file will start the program

# OSCAR-to-Google-and-MSCalendar
A application to automatically fetch course information from Georgia Tech's OSCAR and convert it in to events in Google calendar and Microsoft Calendar

## Get Started

Run 'Calendar-Converter.exe' to launch the program

### Google Calendar
Click 'Google Calendar' which will bring you to the login page. 

Beware that you will get a warning screen when you login since I don't want to bother with Google's verification, and this software is majorly for my personal use only.

### Microsoft Calendar
Click 'Microsoft Calendar' in the login window.
After following with the login prompt in the browser, you will see a blank page with a random generated url
![alt text](gui/icon/MSLogin.PNG)

Simply copy and paste this url in the new window prompted from the program and click 'verify', which will log you in.

## Side Note
Microsoft calendar only provides limited time credentials for the calendar service, which is set to expire 5/21/2023. Renew of credentials is needed at that time
